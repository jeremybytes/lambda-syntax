lambda-syntax
=============
See how to create a lambda expression step-by-step

This project shows how to use lambda expression syntax in
C# by moving from a named delegate to an anonymous delegate to a lambda
expression and then applying some syntactic sugar to the results.

This is an experiment to see if it makes sense to put step-by-step demos 
onto github. (It's also my first time using git, so if it looks like I
have no idea what I'm doing, that's probably the case.)
